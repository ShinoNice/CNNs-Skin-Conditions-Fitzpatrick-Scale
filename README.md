# Classifying Skin Conditions from Fitzpatrick Scale Using CNN Models

Welcome to the Image Classification of Skin Conditions project! This project was developed as part of the Deep Learning course for the 2023/2024 academic year. Our objective is to use Computer Vision (CNNs) techniques to classify various skin problems identified from the Fitzpatrick Scale.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an CNN classification model that is able to correcly classify various skin problems from the images downloaded.

## Data
The data used for this project in imported in the code from the csv file, where multiple https links are located. Due to size constrains I was unable to input here the downloaded image folder. 

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Importing and cleaning the data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Augmenting images and using various steps to prepare the data.
3. **Model Training**: Training CNN models using libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-Learn.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Results
The final model's performance and key findings are detailed in the `CV_Report.pdf` file.

## How to Run
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShinoNice/CNNs-Skin-Conditions-Fitzpatrick-Scale
    cd CNNs-Skin-Conditions-Fitzpatrick-Scale
    ```
